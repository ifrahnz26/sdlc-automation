### EXAMPLE USER STORY WITH FEEDBACK ###

#### USER STORY INPUT:
As a **registered user**, I want **to reset my password via an email verification process**, so that **I can regain access to my account securely if I forget my password**.

#### USER FEEDBACK:
- The system needs to ensure that users can request a password reset multiple times without any risk of account lockout.
- The token expiry time should be adjustable based on system configuration.
- Include a user interface flow description for the password reset request.

#### DESIRED TECHNICAL DESIGN OUTPUT (After Incorporating Feedback):

**1. INTRODUCTION & PURPOSE**  
This document outlines the technical design for the Password Reset functionality, which allows users to securely reset their passwords through an email verification process. It provides clear steps for requesting and confirming password resets, as well as details on the system architecture and security design.

**3. MODULES & COMPONENTS DESIGN**  
- **Auth API Module:** Manages password reset requests and confirmations. Ensures that multiple reset requests can be made without locking out users, by tracking requests and token expiries.
- **Token Service Module:** Generates, validates, and tracks tokens. The token expiry time is configurable via system settings.
- **Notification Service:** Sends email notifications through AWS SES with a password reset link.
- **UI Flow:** Describes the process for users to initiate a reset, including steps to enter an email, receive a reset link, and confirm the new password.

**4. DATA MODEL & SCHEMA DESIGN**  
- **User Table:**  
  - `id` (UUID), `email` (string), `password_hash` (string), `reset_token_hash` (string), `reset_token_expiry` (datetime)  
- **Audit Log Table:**  
  - `log_id`, `user_id`, `action`, `timestamp`, `status`

**5. API DESIGN**  
- **POST /api/v1/auth/reset-request**  
  - Request: `{ "email": "user@example.com" }`  
  - Response: `202 Accepted`
- **POST /api/v1/auth/reset-confirm**  
  - Request: `{ "token": "securetoken", "new_password": "StrongPass#2024" }`  
  - Response: `200 OK`

**6. SEQUENCE & ACTIVITY DIAGRAMS**  
[Insert Sequence Diagram: User -> API -> Token Service -> SES -> User]

**7. SECURITY DESIGN**  
- Ensure HTTPS for all API requests.
- Tokens are encrypted using SHA-256 and are stored with a configurable expiration time.
- Rate limiting and CAPTCHA are implemented to prevent abuse of the reset mechanism.

**8. PERFORMANCE & SCALABILITY**  
- The system is designed to handle up to 3,000 password reset requests per minute, with a response time of no more than 200ms.

**9. ERROR HANDLING & LOGGING**  
- Log failed attempts to reset the password with a timestamp and error code.
- Implement retry logic for failed email notifications.

**10. DEPLOYMENT & ENVIRONMENT DETAILS**  
- Deployed via AWS Lambda, API Gateway, SES, and RDS.
